      <!-- Travel Recommender Project -->

  <h2>Travel Destination Recommender</h2>
  <p>
    I worked on the Travel Destination Recommender as part of a group project that later transitioned into 
    an individual assignment. After collaborating on the initial concept and structure, I cloned the 
    repository and independently implemented the travel recommender API to enhance the application’s 
    functionality. My contributions included designing and developing the Contact page, as well as 
    helping shape the overall visual design and layout of the website. This project highlights my 
    ability to collaborate within a team, take ownership of features, and apply UX principles to 
    create a clear and user-friendly experience.

    <!-- Movie Search Project -->

        <h2>Movie Search App</h2>
     <p>
        The Movie Search App is a web application I created that allows users to 
        search for movies and instantly view detailed information. The focus of 
        this project was designing a simple, user-friendly interface that makes 
        browsing and discovering movies feel intuitive. I paid close attention 
        to layout, readability, and user flow while developing the front end 
        with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making sure the experience stayed 
        clear and responsive.

    <!-- Branding Project -->
    <div class="project-card">
      <img src="images/branding-project.png" alt="Branding UX Design Project">
      <h2>Branding & UX Design Project</h2>
      <p>
        This branding project explores visual identity through color, typography, 
        and layout decisions. Created during my sophomore year, the project 
        demonstrates my early UX thinking by focusing on how branding elements 
        influence user perception and engagement. The work highlights consistency,
         hierarchy, and purposeful design choices across multiple brand assets.

  <h2>Personal UX Portfolio</h2>

  <p>
    This portfolio is an ongoing personal project designed to showcase my UX design,
    front-end development, and visual exploration work. I focused on creating a clear
    information hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and subtle interactions that enhance
    user experience without overwhelming content. The site was built using HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript, with an emphasis on responsiveness, accessibility, and iterative design.

  <h2>Visual Exploration</h2>
  <p>
    Alongside my UX and development work, I explore photography as a creative outlet. 
    This work influences how I think about composition, color, and visual storytelling 
    in digital design.
